## Portfolio 1

The portfolio 1 reveals that the relationships between various variables from ride data and a few analytics riding data. For intance, the relationship between TSS and moving time shows a positive correlation. Then, it explores the differences between the three categories by using scatter plot and highlight with different color. As such, it displays that the distance, moving time, average heartrate and average watts are highly correlated with TSS among there categories, and there is no relationship between the average temperature and TSS within three categories(Race, Right, Workout)




## Portfolio 2

In portfolio 2,  Appliances energy consumption measurement data for the period; Frequency of energy consumption within histogram;  Boxplot of median location of appliances energy consumption; Heat map of appliances' hourly energy consumption for four weeks;  Pairs plot in terms of relationship between the energy consumption of appliances have been demostrated. As such, we know the given nearby data enough to develop the appliances energy consumption prediction. The most important plot for predicting the energy usage of a house is pairplot, which explore the correlation between Temperature and humidity less impact indoor energy usage and the significant correlation is between T1 and T3. What's more, We can see the different time in different day has various energy consumption.



## Portfolio 3
In portfolio 3, the target is classify the book genre. First, filter the book data in order to only assign each text to just one of the genre labels. Then, setup model, as to logistic regression and KNN. Last, learn comparing data in these models by using accuracy score. I figure out that the accuracy score of logistic regression better than accuracy score of KNN.
